# Function
This is an example function. A function receives a `Model`, does some compute, and returns a `Model`. Functions can take additional `inputs`, and output additional `outputs` as well.

By managing your function as code, you can take advantage of all the great tools for code collaboration and deployment offered by GitHub. Like any good repo, your function should have a great `README.md`(like this one) which acts as its documentation. Over time we're going to automate the creation of a preview image, like the one you see below, which'll give you a good idea of what you should expect to see from a function.

Functions are just code, so you're free to compile and run them wherever they're compatible. This function is a .Net Standard 2.0 library written in C# which means you can use it in a Revit addin, a Unity app, or as a "zero touch" library in Dynamo. But if you really want to put your function to work, you can publish it to run on the Hypar platform, making it globally available and executable via Hypar's API. You can see this function running [here](https://hypar.io/functions/hypar-dotnet-starter).

## Getting Started Developing for the Hypar Platform
The [Elements library](https://github.com/hypar-io/elements) is at the heart of the Hypar platform. You author the function logic referencing the Elements library, and publish the function to Hypar, then Hypar executes it for you and stores the results.

You can see some functions written using Hypar Elements running on [Hypar](https://hypar.io). Hypar is just one example of a business that can be built on top of this tool. We fully expect you'll go and build your own cool thing.

- Go to https://www.hypar.io/ and sign up.
- Install [.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/)
- Install a good integrated development environment (IDE). We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [C# for Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp). [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is also a great choice.
- Install the Hypar CLI:
  - Download for:
    - [Windows](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypar-cli/hypar-win-x64.zip)
    - [Mac](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypar-cli/hypar-osx.10.12-x64.zip)
    - [Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hypar-cli/hypar-linux-x64.zip)
      - Linux requires that additional dependencies be installed to support .net. Those can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore21#linux-distribution-dependencies).
  - Make the CLI available on your command line by putting it in your path or making a symbolic link:
    - On Mac and Linux: `ln -s <path to hypar executable> /usr/local/bin/hypar`
    - On windows add `<path to hypar>` to your user `PATH`.
- Create a function from the command line:
```
hypar new <function id>
```
This will clone the function repo to the folder `<function id>`. Of course, you can replace `<function id>` with anything you like. The function project is a buildable .net class library which references the Elements [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hypar.Elements/).
- Edit the `hypar.json`. The `hypar.json` file describes the interface for your function. At the top of the `hypar.json` file, the `hypar-schema` is referenced. In Visual Studio Code you'll get code completion and documentation as you author the `hypar.json`.
- Use the CLI to generate input and output classes and a function stub. From the same directory as your `hypar.json` do:
`hypar init`. This will generate `Input.gs.cs` and `Output.g.cs` classes which have properties which match your input and output properties. Additionally, it will generate a `<function-id>.g.cs` whose `Execute(...)` method is where you put your business logic.
- Build
```
dotnet build
```
- Use the Hypar CLI to publish your function.
```
cd <function directory>
hypar publish
```
- Preview `.glb` models generated by Hypar locally using the [glTF Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/gltf-vscode), or [Don McCurdy's online glTF Viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/).

## Testing
```
cd test
dotnet test
```

## Previewing
Live preview of functions use some of the components available in Hypar's components library, which are written in Typescript and made available as an npm package. To run the live preview functionality, you'll need to [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) then do:
```
cd live
npm install
```
Then, when you're ready to run do the following in the `/live` directory:
```
live-server
```
The test application in the `/live` directory references `model.glb` which is created by the tests. If you'd like to see the model update in real time, do the following in the `/test` directory:
```
dotnet watch test
```
This will watch for changes in all the files used for testing, and will automatically rebuild and run the tests.
